    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is gaming. Recently Nintendo has brought
    new information on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
    <p>Nintendo has a starting line up of Zelda: Breath of the wild
        has me excited. Skyrim feels ok, but let's be honest, I think everyone's
        had enough of skyrim remade. Other title that are coming out later
        like Super Mario Odyssey are things to look forward to.</p>

    <p>As exciting as things are, there are things that I don't like.
        While it can't be helped, the Switches' battery life is short. On a
        demanding game like the new Zelda, the battery life is 3 hours,
        normally the average battery life is around 2.5 to 6 hours. The fact
        that some peripherals are also sold separately rather than included in
        the Switch package is kind of a turn off.</p>
    <p>These are my thoughts so far. More to come later!</p>
